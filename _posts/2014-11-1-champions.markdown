It's 1:45 am local time and I've got to crank this out. As per the Friends Blogging Challenge rules, if I don't hit 'Send' on this thing before my head hits the pillow, Ryan is going to take a 750 word dump of a slanderous guest post on this very page and I can't have that happening.

So I'm going to take a deep breath, quiet my perfectionist voice, and deprive myself of the few minutes it takes to talk about...

## Champions

Today a person I love and respect very much looked me in the eye and said, "You know, most people who say they're self made really aren't. But you made yourself, kiddo."

While I appreciated the line of conversation- the cool stuf I had been doing, how successful I am, how bright my future is -I could think of about 15 people off the top of my head who had helped me accomplish becoming independent and carving out a decent living. This *doesn't* include the countless people I'm too clueless to name, or the detractors whose doubt and ridicule have fed the fire that propels me forward.

No one is self made. We all have champions.

## Identifying a Champion

Champions genuinely like and care about you. Mentors that are disdainful of you aren't good mentors and should be politely discarded. Life is too short.

Champions respect you enough to be real with you. "Like and care about" doesn't equal "Coddle and sugar-coat reality for". Some of the most uncomfortable conversations will happen between you and your Champions. That's great because these are low-risk people to be real with. They want you to succeed.

Champions have had some time to observe you. They don't have to have known you since you were a tiny baby, but having a period of regular contact or several 'life moment touch points' (god I am tired) helps foster a relationship of real understanding.

Champions ~*~INSPIRE U ~*~. It's cheese, but it's real cheese. A quick and dirty litmus test for determining your champions is asking yourself whose conversations make you feel like hopping up from the table and doing the hard work to become a better version of yourself.

Champions never give advice. They reframe the question in a way that helps you uncover new information.

## Keeping Your Champions

This weekend, I've had a chance to reconnect with a lot of old champions. I co-taught an honors english class with a professor who didn't shut me up when I had nothing of value to say but talked ceaselessly anyway. I was the kid who never read the book but found a way to have an opinion about it.

I spent five ours joking and conversing with someone whose sense of humor and social skills I hold as the gold standard. He's a man who bought me Nutella to help prepare for an AP test, and who still talked to me after I got a measly 3.

After 6 long years, I had the pleasure of seeing my BF from high school who hangs out with me despite the fact that she's an immensely talented, stylish, upwardly mobile actual genius who dates in the NYC banking elite circles. Howwww are we even friends?

I sat down at Panera bread and drank cup after cup of coffee with a couple that put me on the right track at 13 and have continued to help me adjust my path through risky decisions and major life moments.

How do I manage to surround myself with people so lovely as this? It's not easy, and frankly I'm not very good at it. Occasionally I try the following exercise.

### The Funeral 5

When my grandfather died last fall of Parkinson's Disease, 5 people spoke at his funeral: his sister, his wife, his son (my father), his daughter, and a childhood friend.

Several days after the ceremony, my partner Luke and I discussed which 5 people we would invite to speak at our funeral; the people who knew our flaws and would acknowledge them delicately while amplifying the qualities in ourselves that are most admirable.

The people we picked isn't the point. The point is that I had 3 people on my list that I hadn't talked to in over six months. SIX MONTHS I had gone without even an email, and here I expected them to come tearfully say some nice things about me.

If, in thinking about this now, you discover that there are people on your Funeral 5 that you've neglected to contact, put a recurring calendar reminder

## Conclusion

This blog post is stream-of-concious shitty, but now I get to write 750 words about whatever I want on Ryan Donaldson's blog **and** I've written public shout outs to five people I love dearly dearly so it's not all bad.

(PS: RIP Grandpa. I wear your J. Crew sweater all the time.)

Goodnight.
