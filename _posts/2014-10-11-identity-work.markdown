I almost punched someone at a wedding once.

During my time studying abroad in Kunming, China, I met a Ukrainian women at a modeling gig who offered to shoot and print me a portfolio. I never took her up on the offer, but that didn't keep me from being invited to her wedding a month later.

Looking back on it, I should have known that there would be oddballs in attendance. The couple was sweet, but a little off. As the night went on and people got progressively drunker, my friends and I were approached by a guy named Boris. Boris latched himself uncomfortably to my friend Rob. There he stood for several increasingly uncomfortable minutes, hanging from Rob's shoulder and staring at me.

Finally, he interrupted me mid-story to ask in a thick Russian accent, "Are you a man or a woman?"

This isn't the first time my gender has come under question. I've been 'sir'd and 'mister'd all my life and, frankly, I've never really minded it. But other people seem to mind. A lot.

Sometimes this confusion is harmless, or even somewhat funny to me. When folks who called me 'sir' heard my voice or saw me from a different angle or whatever, they'd apologize profusely. One time I had an old lady about half my height throw herself against me trying to keep me out of a public women's restroom until I convinced her I was where I needed to be.

But I've also seen and experienced the physical threat of blurring gender lines. Growing up in a conservative part of rural Pennsylvania, schools did little to protect me or my openly queer friends from being shoved in the hallway, verbally abused in the classrooms, or worse.

The violence I've personally experienced has been minimal compared to others I know, but it's important for my story to have room. It's important for me to remember that I've been taught that being queer is met with violence and attempts to 'fix it'.

As I cycled through these thoughts, Boris repeated his question more forcefully, "Are you a MAN," he asked, "or a WOMAN?"

My friends stood in silence waiting to hear my response. I surprised more than just myself when I said slowly, calmly, "Whatever, man. Get out of here." I didn't feel the need to respond, but I also didn't identify enough with either of those words to feel comfortable choosing one.

While Boris was talking, another friend had stepped forward and tried to pull the guy away from me, but he was unrelenting. He needed to know "what I was", and I wasn't willing to engage. It took me several seconds after walking away to realize that my hands were balled into tight fists, shaking.

Why was I angry? I thought to myself.

I have opinions about all kinds of dumb things. Ask me when I think Lady Gaga's career peaked (the release of ARTPOP, next question) or the best flavor of David Sunflower Seeds (dill pickle, next question) and I have well-formed - if somewhat unpopular - opinions.

Gender has always been the question I couldn't answer.

I can be impulsive in my retail purchases and spontaneous in my Friday night party plans, but when it comes to taking action in my personal life I move slow. I need everything I do be an honest representation of my authentic self.

Sometimes this is a good thing. I've avoided getting any regrettable tattoos, for example. However, my fear of getting 'me' wrong has also limited my ability to experiment.  

Despite grappling with my gender identity from a young age, I've avoided being vocal about my gender identity, exploring the use of 'they/them' pronouns, or inhabiting queer spaces because I hate offering up my budding self assurance for a call-out. This makes me feel like a coward. It keeps me from feeling self-actualized.

## Doing the Work

This year I want to humble myself before myself. There's still (hopefully) a long way to go and a lot more to learn along the way. There's work to be done and that work is me.

## What I've Got So Far

I'm genderqueer.

## The Rules

I want to set some ground rules for myself that may also be helpful for other genderqueer cuties who feel sort of groundless.

1. I allow myself to continue examining questions of identity forever and ever until I die.
2. I allow myself to adapt and redetermining my identity as old questions are answered, and new ones crop up.
3. I allow myself to experiment with my presentation, even if it makes others uncomfortable.
4. I commit myself to [blockin' out the haters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyubEwigfUY) lovingly but firmly 24/7/365.
5. I absolve myself the responsibility of explaining the gory details of my identity to anyone I don't think deserves an explanation.

I hope these rules will help me sleep better, be more comfortable with myself, and continue to do the important work of shaping and defining who I am.

## Recommended Reading

I sat and read almost all of this book [Gender Failure](http://www.amazon.com/Gender-Failure-Ivan-E-Coyote-ebook/dp/B00H6UZX5Y/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1413093400&sr=8-1&keywords=gender+failure) in one sitting. It's by two gender retirees (they get into it in the book), Rae Spoon and Ivan Coyote, and it affirms and puts words to some of the nebulous thoughts I've been having.
