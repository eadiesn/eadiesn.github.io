My name is [Sarah Eadie](http://www.twitter.com/eadiest), and I’m a content marketer. I write for brands and they give me money. Sometimes I manage the production of photo essays or video content for money, too.

Yes, I’m motivated by money. I hope you are, too. If the people you’re working for are making money off of your creativity, fight and get yours.

But sometimes the money motivator is limiting. I’m required to hush my personal tastes and give the brand center stage. I can’t do something just because I think it will be fun/funny/weird/really cool/scary. And I’ve read enough books on creativity and process to know that it’s the weird shit you do for you that helps you grow.

So what’s stopped me from personal blogging in the past? Laziness.

“It’s haaaaard,” my little Sarah voice whines. “It’s hard to write all day and then go home and write.” That’s a challenge I suspect a lot of people face. Some days we come home and we’re physically exhausted. We’re too worn out to do creative work. Other times, on particularly difficult days, we feel insecure about our ability to even do good work so we don’t even try.

I guess [my friend Ryan](http://ryanjdonaldson.com/) was tired of succumbing to his insecure inner voices, too, because one day I got an email with a challenge. This email sparked what we’re (I’m) calling:

![So sparkle. Much challenge.](/assets/article_images/2014-09-30-friends-blogging-challenge-launch/friends-blogging-challenge.gif)

It’s been proven that doing something with a partner increases the rate that you follow-through on the stuff you say you’re going to do.

*(Don’t ask me for a source, please. Just Google it.)*

Our hope is that by blogging together we can hold ourselves accountable and challenge eachother to be better writers and creatives.

The Friends Blogging Challenge is gonna start nice and easy. **The rules are:**

1. Produce two, 750+ word posts per month about anything.
2. Deadlines for these two posts are before work on the 1st and the 15th each month.
3. Each post should have at least one hero image because we’re not brutes. Additional images/video are encouraged, but not required.
4. Don’t be a jerk. Leave a comment on the other person’s blog post once a month.

The penalty for breaking any of these rules is that the other person gets to guest post about anything they want on your blog. Considdering our propensity for toilet humor and NSFW rap music, you better believe that this penalty would be damning.

Three months from now we may up the ante on the challenge to compare number of visits or something, but for now it’s super simple. Write about the stuff you’re thinking about. Do it twice a month. Support your blogging friend. Repeat.

There are a couple of things that I think about pretty regularly. These are the topics you can expect to read about here:

![It's complicated!](/assets/article_images/2014-09-30-friends-blogging-challenge-launch/identity-politics.gif)

I’m pretty sure that I’m misusing the phrase ‘identity politics’, but nothing else quite fits. To me, this includes conversations about the identities I claim, the thought processes that bring me to those conclusions, and what that means in the context of greater society. Expect feminist rants and gender confusion.

![I read a bunch!](/assets/article_images/2014-09-30-friends-blogging-challenge-launch/business-books.gif)

John Waters once said that success means never having to work with assholes or check how much a book costs before buying it. There’s a reason that man is my hero.

I read a lot and a lot of what I read is business books. Think Seth Godin and *Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion*. These books shape what I write and think about. So, if I’m feeling it, I may do semi-regular book reviews or round-up lists of my favorite reading material from a past month or something. I love books!


![How Do I Art?](/assets/article_images/2014-09-30-friends-blogging-challenge-launch/creative-process.gif)

This encompasses a bunch of different interests and will likely overlap a lot with identity. I’ll talk about the creative process of dressing yourself in a way you love (see my failed blog: The Modular Wardrobe Project), writing in a way you don’t hate, and finding inspiration wherever you go.

I’m also entranced by pop culture, fashion, Kanye West, personal finance, [YASS cat](https://vine.co/v/OzQaIO0IOiu), and the internet.

One cool woman in my life once told me to “just keep blogging, even if you don’t know what your blog will ultimately be about.” So until I hit it big and can hire people to blog on my behalf and photoshop my Instagram photos, I’ll be here trying to inspire and make my friends proud.
