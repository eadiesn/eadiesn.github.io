Real talk. I'm tired of paying other people to tell me things I already know about myself.

There's relief to reading your truth in someone else's words, but it's not as potent as writing your own truth. Rewriting your truth. Editing your own truth. Cutting your truth down to size and then building it back up again. Hating it and hating it and hating it until you open up the doc a few days later. Rereading your truth articulated perfectly in your own words.

*That's* powerful.

These days - the Golden Age of the Info Product - reading your truth in someone else's words comes at a cost. Like, a money cost. You're not only listening to someone else parrot your truth back to you, nicely synthesized, tugging heavy on the heart strings, but you're paying them to hear it.

It's not always clear what you get back.

Sometimes the person you're paying to hear your truth doesn't share your values. Then it gets really tricky. Here's this person, speaking to you, offering to solve your problem. But they don't care about you or people like you.

You have to decide whether the truths they're peddling are valuable enough to say, "Ok, sure. Here's my money. I'll ignore it when I see you talking shit on Twitter."

If the thought of that makes you feel gross, you have a few options.

First, you can look harder to find the same truths coming from someone who shares your values and belief systems, someone you really see yourself in.

Alternatively, you can write until you see yourself represented.

When you read in new age-y books that "you are already enough" or "you already have everything you need to be successful", I think this is the introspection-based problem solving they're talking about.

Writing until you see yourself represented. Solving your own problems. Being self-actualized and feeling like a goddamn person, not a hangover personified.

How do you do that? Maybe you could...

## Identify the Problem

Sometimes I don't feel like a person. I'm depressed or outraged or my stomach hurts (like right now, actually), and I don't feel quite real.

When I find myself in this situation, I try to ask myself 'why'. What would it take to feel like a person? What would it feel like to know the answer?

Separating myself from my situation helps me identify the problem. Sometimes I visualize myself sitting across from myself in two leather chairs on a stage working through problems like I'm at a Sarah Eadie conference for being a better Sarah Eadie.

What does the best version of myself think the problem is? Meditate on that.

When none of that works, I move to the process of elimination. I do something. Then I ask, does this work? No? Cross it off the list, and do another thing. Does this work? No? Cross it off the list. Crossing, crossing until you get to 'yes'. Making the mental note.

## Rewrite the Guidebooks

If you don't see models of success based on your reality, you have to create it.

This is where looking at what exists already can be helpful. Once you've determined what the problem is, look at the ways other people have answered that problem.

Read books and articles on creative process, communication, and success - whatever you're excited about. Tailor the parts you agree with to your situation and who you are. Edit the parts that you disagree with to reflect how *you* would go about doing things.

Sometimes this is really scary. You're challenging people who are already accomplished than you, they may even be your idols. But I think one of the most powerful things you can do, if you're willing and able, is to be visible. If you're talking about what matters to you in a direct and piercing way, people will find you.

## Bonus Material

Here are some tangental thoughts that may help you accomplish the big and scary work I'm asking you for above.

**Buy your own hype.** If you're not buying your own hype, you've lost. If you can't find your hype, scroll up and figure out how.

**Bless your enemies.** There is no victory *over* anyone aside from winning at doing your own shit and being successful on YOUR terms.

**Get used to being lonely.** One time I asked this cool dude for advice on being hip and successful. This is what he told me. I'm still not sure if he was trolling me or being serious, but it seems important. You will be lonely at first. The right people will show up.
